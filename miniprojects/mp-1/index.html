        <h4>About Me</h4>
        <p>I'm a dedicated student from a small town in the Midwest working toward a bachelor's degree in computer
            science at Boston University. I'm in my third year now, and I love it here in Boston; I've had the
            opportunity to meet so many fun and interesting people and learn a lot along the way.
            <br><br>
            My interests are myriad; I love writing, reading, art, programming, and even doing a bit of cooking on the
            side. Art and writing (particularly novels and short stories) are how I best express myself, and I
            thoroughly enjoy being creative and inventive with my friends. I am an active learner, and I love to try
            new things. I adapt quickly to new situations and environments, and I'm always working to hone my skills.
            <br><br>
            Every day, I strive to do better and challenge myself to reach new heights. I pride myself on a job
            done right, and I am a bit of a perfectionist when it comes to my craft. Additionally, I'm always on the
            lookout for new connections and new opportunities!
